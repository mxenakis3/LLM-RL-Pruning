1) UTILS
- Create new branch off main
- Create a utils file at the project folder level
- Add utility functions to the util file
  - get environment
  - get render mode

2) PPO
- Figure out how to introduce LLM into the notebook

1) (Optional) Get tool calling in Deepseek API?
- If this is difficult, don't worry about it

2) TEXAS HOLD EM 
- Update get_environment utils function to support texas holdem (see (1) for info about utils function)
- Create new notebook for texas_holdem (no llm agent)
- Tune parameters for texas_hold_em (solve the environment)
  - Look up a good solution if one exists
  - Try PPO first
  - Use PPO_interaction class in the notebook
  - See lunar lander examples for reference
- Create LLM agent for texas hold EM
  - Chain of thought prompting OR
  - ReAct prompting
  - Look at configs/agent_configs/a_lunarlander_cot_agent.py for reference on how to structure a cot prompting
  - Ask Matheo/ go online for how to setup ReAct prompting
- Integrate LLM agent with PPO implementation
  - Put in same notebook as non-llm agent
  - Save plots in the notebook

3) Overcooked
- Update get_environment utils function to support Overcooked
- Create new notebook implementing Overcooked with PPO
- Tune parameters
  - Look up a good solution if one exists
  - Try PPO first
  - Use PPO_interaction class in the notebook
  - See lunar lander examples for reference
- Create LLM agent for Overcooked
  - CoT agent will likely work best here
- Integrate LLM agent into PPO implementation
  - Put in same notebook
  - Save plots in notebook
